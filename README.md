# Byte Translator (aka. Byte Whisperer)
This is an OpenChirp service that translates raw byte streams from devices
into meaningful values.

Do note that this service uses a simple and non-optimized approach for sending values
across a channel. To use a more optimized serializer, please use
[Easybits](https://github.com/OpenChirp/easybits).
